        <h3>Review of Neurotechnology</h3>
        <p>Neurotechnology refers to any method or technological equipment that interacts with the nervous system to monitor or regulate brain activity. Common design aims for neurotechnologies include using brain activity readings to control external devices such as neuroprosthetics, modifying neural activity through neuromodulation to heal or restore function impacted by neurological disorders, or boosting cognitive capacities. In addition to their medicinal or commercial applications, neurotechnologies are effective research tools for advancing basic neuroscience knowledge.
